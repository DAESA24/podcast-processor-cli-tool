# Spotify Podcast Transcription Sub-Agent - Project Checkpoint

**Date:** 2025-09-17
**Project:** Claude Code Sub-Agent for Spotify Podcast Transcription
**Status:** Planning Phase - Ready for BMAD Workflow

## Project Overview

Creating a Claude Code sub-agent that:
1. Takes Spotify podcast URL as input
2. Downloads audio file from podcast
3. Uses OpenAI Whisper API for transcription
4. Formats output into structured markdown file
5. Integrates as CLI command within Claude Code

## Key Decisions Made

- **Research Finding:** Otter.ai has no official public API for developers
- **Decision:** Use OpenAI Whisper API instead
- **Benefits:** Official API, excellent accuracy, good for podcast-length content

### Markdown Format Structure Designed

#### Metadata Header (YAML frontmatter):
```yaml
---
title: "Podcast Episode Title"
podcast_name: "Podcast Series Name"
episode_number: "Episode #123"
spotify_url: "https://open.spotify.com/episode/..."
transcription_date: "2025-09-17"
duration: "45:32"
file_size: "42.3 MB"
language: "en"
quality: "high"
---
```

#### Content Structure:
- Episode summary with auto-generated key topics
- Speaker identification (Host/Guest with icons)
- Timestamp-based sections with navigation links
- Quality indicators and confidence scores
- Clickable navigation for quick reference

#### File Naming Convention:
```
[podcast-name]-ep[###]-[episode-title-slug]-transcript-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### Technical Architecture Outline

**Workflow:** Spotify URL → Audio Download → Whisper API → Markdown Formatting → File Save

**Key Components:**
- Spotify API integration for audio extraction
- OpenAI Whisper API for transcription with timestamps
- Markdown template engine for consistent formatting
- Claude Code sub-agent CLI integration
- Error handling for API failures and audio format issues

## BMAD Method Integration

### Status: Framework Installed & Ready
- ✅ BMAD Core installed in `.bmad-core/` directory
- ✅ All agents available (orchestrator, analyst, pm, architect, dev, qa, sm)
- ✅ Enhanced IDE Development Workflow identified as optimal path

### Recommended Workflow: Greenfield Service
**Planning Phase Agents (5 total):**
1. **Analyst** → Research Spotify API + Whisper integration patterns
2. **Product Manager** → Define CLI interface, error handling, file formats
3. **Architect** → Design audio processing pipeline architecture
4. **Product Manager** → Refine requirements based on architecture
5. **Product Owner** → Validate document consistency

**Development Phase Agents:**
6. **Scrum Master** → Break into implementable stories
7. **Developer** → Code implementation
8. **QA/Test Architect** → Quality assurance and testing

## Next Steps

### Option A: Full BMAD Planning Workflow
```bash
# Activate orchestrator and run planning
@bmad-orchestrator
*plan
```

### Option B: Direct Agent Activation
```bash
# Jump directly to analyst for requirements gathering
@bmad-orchestrator
*agent analyst
```

### Option C: Skip Planning (Not Recommended)
```bash
# Jump directly to scrum master for story creation
@bmad-orchestrator
*agent sm
```

## Context for Next Session

**Project Scope:** Well-defined, right-sized for BMAD testing
**Technical Complexity:** Multi-API integration requiring architecture planning
**Business Value:** Reusable automation tool with real-world utility
**BMAD Readiness:** Framework installed, workflow selected, ready to proceed

**Key Files Created:**
- Project planning discussion and markdown format design (conversation history)
- BMAD framework installed in `.bmad-core/`
- This checkpoint summary in `drews-artifacts/`

**Recommended Resume Point:** Activate BMAD Orchestrator and begin with `*plan` for comprehensive planning workflow.
